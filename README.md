<h3>The Movie Recommender App</h3>
<br>
<h3>Using Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>

 <br>
The Movie Recommender App, is an application that has been developed and trained using machine learning algorithms; KNearestNeighbours, BeautifulSoup4, and requests. <br>
The app has the ability to recommend movies that are almost/similar to the movies that a user of the application will input in the form.  <br>
There is also an alternative given using dropdown menu where thousands of movies have been referenced, the user only scrolls up and down and then requests for the recommendation.
 <br>
Some of the motivations that made me think and develop this one was the environment I stay at, the guys are real movie 'watchers', and this is one of their tools for more movies. <br>
In the application’s architecture, the MovieDB API has been deployed in order to help give better recommendations and also give the exact movie ID and its images from the source. <br>
Just as Netflix, Spotify or Goojar does it. <br>
The personal focus was to deploy a machine learning application software online, this has been fun :) 

Architecture:
 <br>
The application’s frontend has been developed typically using python’s streamlit module, and the streamlit options for menu, navigation buttons and responsiveness. <br>
The use of python has been intensely used in this project to solidify my skills and also dive in machine learning approach to real world problems. <br>
This has thus been used to develop the service for the entire application. <br>
 <br>
Challenges:
 <br>
One of the major challenges I encountered for a couple of weeks is the publishing of this application to my github repository.  <br>
The problem was due to the large pickled model trained that was more than 100mb in size. Github actions could not run my python script to dump the model after training. <br>
Finally, I used the git-lfs to push to my repository at the end of it. <br>
Something I learnt about this project as a software engineer, which is quite motivating is that we can encounter several obstacles as they always are during a development process,
 <br>but this however does not stop the main idea and aims to be achieved. At the end of it, the work shall not go down.

The model can be accessed via the link: https://movie-recommender-app-aba.onrender.com  <br>

As part of the improvements made, the dropdown is simplified, genres are selectible and movies added <br>

The aid for French, German and Spanish language translation is yet to be implemented. <br>
